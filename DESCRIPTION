Package: shoeprintr
Title: Performs an automated statistical matching of two shoeprints
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: c(
    person("Soyoung", "Park", email = "sypark@iastate.edu", role = c("aut", "cre")),
    person("Alicia", "Carriquiry", email = "alicia@iastate.edu", role = "aut"))
Description: Implements a number of statistical routines in order to
    quantitatively assess whether two shoeprints are a match. It does this by
    using a maximum clique computation to find regions of each shoeprint which
    are most similar. The output will then provide a number of statistics
    assessing this similarity.
